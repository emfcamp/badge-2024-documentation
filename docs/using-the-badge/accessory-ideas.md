## General Accessories

The badge uses a USB-C to USB-C cable as the lanyard - any USB-C cable will do, we recommend one around a meter long but it's up to you! You can also use regular lanyards if you would prefer.

Some suitable cables are:

- [A glowing charging cable](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charging-iPhone-Samsung-Galaxy-Laptops/dp/B0CQ2ZY9M6/)
  
- [Another glowing one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charger-Glowing-Aluminum-Charging-Colorful/dp/B0CNXTWL2M/
  
- [Guess what? It glows.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sikai-Charger-Charging-Braeathing-Compatible/dp/B0BVW12VJ3/)

You can also use one that doesn't glow, search for "usb c to usb c", or add "rgb" on the end if you want to research your own glowing ones.
: Note, that we do not recommend metal-shrouded usb cables as they can short circuits if they touch hexpansions.
