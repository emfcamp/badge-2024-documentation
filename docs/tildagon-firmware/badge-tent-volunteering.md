# Volunteering

## Badge Tent Volunteering

During EMF2024, we'll have a badge tent where attendees can come to pick up
their badge and get help. We need volunteers to help staff the tent.

Tasks include:

- Badge assembly
- Badge flashing
- Badge distribution
- Troubleshooting

Signup instructions will be posted here closer to the event.
