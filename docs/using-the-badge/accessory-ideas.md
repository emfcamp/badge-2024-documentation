### Fancy lanyard

The badge uses a USB-C to USB-C cable as the lanyard - any USB-C cable will do, we recommend one around a meter long but it's up to you! You can also use regular lanyards if you would prefer.

Some suitable cables are:

- [A glowing charging cable](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charging-iPhone-Samsung-Galaxy-Laptops/dp/B0CQ2ZY9M6/)

- [Another glowing one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Charger-Glowing-Aluminum-Charging-Colorful/dp/B0CNXTWL2M/)

- [Guess what? It glows.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sikai-Charger-Charging-Braeathing-Compatible/dp/B0BVW12VJ3/)

You can also use one that doesn't glow, search for "usb c to usb c", or add "rgb" on the end if you want to research your own glowing ones.
: Note, that we do not recommend metal-shrouded usb cables as they can short circuits if they touch hexpansions.

!!! info "Lanyard not lighting up?"

    Unfortunately, not all badges support the glowing USB cables. We're not currently sure why.

### Share your addon
