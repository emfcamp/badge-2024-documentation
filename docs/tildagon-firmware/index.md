## Tildagon OS Firmware

Although hardware is complete and ordered for emfcamp 2024, the firmware is
still in development. If you would like to get involved with writing the
micropython code that interfaces with badge hardware, provides programming
interfaces for apps, and provides a user interface, then please get in touch
with the badge team.
