# Hexpansion interface

Hexpansions are modular nodes in a star-topology network attached to the base board.

Each hexpansion plugs into the base board using a PCB edge connector that shares a form factor with the popular modular network interface SFP.

Hexpansions do not have to have an electrical connection at all. They may be any material of 1mm thickness. We encourage people to be creative in their use of materials. 1mm thick cardboard is an excellent material for making decorative hexpansions

Electronic hexpansions will be provided with the following facilities:

* 3.3V supply at up to 600mA
* 9 gpio pins - 4 connected directly to the main MCU, 5 connected to an i/o expander
* 1 hexpansion detection pin - when this pin is connected to GND, it will request power from the baseboard, which, unless inhibited by software, will enable the 3.3V supply
* 2 pins for an i2c interface. The hexpansion may, but doesn't have to, provide an i2c-attached eeprom from a list of known parts. This eeprom can be a hexpansion identification/description, but it may also contain code, that the user of the badge will be able to run if they choose once the hexpansion has been inserted
* lots of gnd pins

Hexpansions have a default hexagonal size and shape, but may extend outside the specified shape within documented constraints

There will be mechanical mounting posts for hexpansions to attach to the baseboard with 2mm screws. This is only necessary if the hexpansions are expected to experience mechanical load

## Supported EEPROMs

The following EEPROMs are supported on your hexpansion, more may be supported in the future:

* ZD24C64A-XGMT
* M24C16-RMN6TP

You may not use address 0x77 on the badge I2C bus (if you do, the I2C connection between your hexpansion and the badge will be disabled).
