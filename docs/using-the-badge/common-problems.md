## Detecting hexpansions

Normally, hexpansions are detected immediately on being plugged in, indicated by a light illuminating them. Sometimes they may not be detected automatically. Rebooting the badge can help with this, but there is an additional method on firmware v1.6.0 and above.

If you press and hold the boop button, then press the edge button to the left of the hexpansion port you've inserted something in to, it will force a detection.

For example, if you plug a hexpansion into the port on the right-hand side of the badge and it doesn't detect, you can press boop and button B at the same time to trigger detection. Once you've finished with this hexpansion, pressing boop again will trigger a removal.

## Unable to update

If your badge fails the update, try moving to a spot with better WiFi. If the updates continues to fail, you may have to follow the steps to [flash your badge](./end-user-manual.md#flash-your-badge).
